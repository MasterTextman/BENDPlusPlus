# BENDPlusPlus
A databender made in C++. A work in progress that might not be too functional...

## Functions
Currently all it can do is convert a file into formatted hex code, and back.
This essentially means that you can manually databend by editing the hexcode file produced,
and converting it back into a binary file using the C++ code.

What's next is to make the program itself perform the databending. The first step is to make random databending.
